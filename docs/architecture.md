# Architecture

This document describes the internal architecture of `dosev` – its components, data flow, and key design decisions.

---

## Overview

`dosev` is an asynchronous DNS resolver and server built on Python's `asyncio`. It is split into several logical layers:

1. **Configuration** – loading and validating settings from an INI file.
2. **Server** – listening for incoming DNS queries over multiple protocols (UDP, TCP, TLS, HTTPS).
3. **Resolver** – the core logic that processes queries, applies blocklists, handles caching, performs DNSSEC validation, and forwards to upstreams.
4. **Transports** – protocol-specific client implementations for upstream communication (UDP, TCP, TLS, HTTPS, QUIC).
5. **Utilities** – helpers for blocklist fetching, logging, and metrics.

All components are designed to be modular and testable.

## Core Components

### 1. `DNSResolver` (dosev/resolver.py)

The heart of the system. It manages:

- **Caches**: positive cache (TTL-based), negative cache (NXDOMAIN/NODATA), and stale-serve logic.
- **Blocklists & Hosts**: exact-match and suffix-based domain filtering; static A/AAAA overrides.
- **Upstream management**: supports `failover`, `parallel`, `random`, and `roundrobin` strategies; configured via `load_balancing` in the config. Also includes health checks (circuit breaker) and TCP fallback on truncated UDP responses.
- **DNSSEC**: validates responses using a trust anchor (bundled or IANA-fetched); caches validation results. Respects the client's CD (Checking Disabled) flag – if set, validation is skipped. Includes **KeyTrap mitigation** (CVE-2023-50387) with configurable limits on signature validations, DNSKEY records, and validation timeouts. **Chain validation** (enabled by default via `dnssec_chain_validation`) recursively fetches DS/DNSKEY records to build the full chain of trust, with crypto operations offloaded to a thread executor (`_CRYPTO_EXECUTOR`) to prevent event loop blocking.
- **Cache poisoning prevention**: scrubs unsolicited NS records from the authority section (RFC 2181 Section 5.4.1) to prevent injection attacks (CVE-2025-11411). Configurable via `dns_scrub_unsolicited_ns`.
- **EDNS0**: parses client subnet and forwards it to upstreams. **ECS support** (enabled by default via `dns_ecs_enabled`) truncates client IPs to privacy-safe prefixes (/24 for IPv4, /56 for IPv6 per RFC 7871) before forwarding to upstreams.
- **Rate limiting**: token-bucket per client IP, now **actually enforced** in all transport handlers via `_check_rate_limit()`.
- **Rebinding protection**: strips or blocks private IPs.
- **Metrics**: collects request counts, errors, and latency.
- **Request coalescing**: single-flight deduplication for concurrent identical queries, with per-caller ID/CD bit stamping.
- **Bailiwick verification**: `_is_in_bailiwick()` validates whether record names fall within the queried name's zone of authority (RFC 5452 §3).

#### Health Checks
The resolver periodically tests each upstream using a DNS query (default: SOA for root). If an upstream fails `unhealthy_threshold` consecutive checks, it is marked unhealthy and skipped during query routing. After `cooldown` seconds and `healthy_threshold` successful checks, it is restored. If all upstreams are unhealthy, the resolver uses all of them as a fallback.

#### TCP Fallback
If an upstream returns a UDP response with the TC (truncation) bit set, the resolver automatically retries the same query over TCP to that upstream, returning the full response.

**Key Methods**:
- `forward_dns_query(data: bytes) -> bytes` – the main entry point for processing a raw DNS query.
- `_try_upstream(upstream, data) -> bytes` – sends a query to a single upstream, with retries.
- `_wire_cache_get_valid(key) -> Optional[bytes]` – fetches a cached response, with stale-serve logic.
- `_dnssec_validate(qname, response) -> None` – validates DNSSEC signatures with KeyTrap mitigation.
- `_scrub_unsolicited_sections(response, qname) -> bytes` – removes out-of-bailiwick NS records.
- `_attach_ecs_option(query_data, client_ip) -> bytes` – attaches ECS option to query.

### 2. Server Layer (dosev/server.py)

Provides listeners for:
- **UDP**: `asyncio.DatagramProtocol` with rate limiting.
- **TCP**: `asyncio.StreamReader` / `StreamWriter` with rate limiting.
- **TLS (DoT)**: TCP with SSL context on port 853.
- **HTTPS (DoH)**: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 servers using `aiohttp` and `aioquic`.
- **HTTP/3**: `Http3ServerProtocol` for QUIC-based DoH.

Each listener accepts a query, passes it to the resolver, and sends back the response. All transports enforce rate limiting via `_check_rate_limit()`.

**Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handlers (SIGINT, SIGTERM) trigger a clean shutdown, closing all listeners, connection pools, and background tasks.

### 3. Transports (client-side)

Each transport implements the protocol-specific forwarding logic:
- `_forward_udp()`
- `_forward_tcp()`
- `_forward_tls()`
- `_forward_https1()`, `_forward_https2()`, `_forward_https3()`
- `_forward_quic()` – uses a connection pool (`_quic_pool`) to reuse QUIC connections across multiple queries, reducing handshake overhead.

These handle connection pooling, timeouts, retries, certificate pinning, and the `ip` field to skip DNS resolution.

**HTTP/3 DoH Pooling**: The new `H3DohProtocol` and `H3ConnectionPool` classes provide proper QUIC stream management and connection reuse for HTTP/3 DoH upstreams.

### 4. Caching

Two-layer cache:
- **DNS cache** (`_dns_cache`): stores parsed responses (used for upstream IP resolution).
- **Wire cache** (`_wire_cache`): stores raw wire-format responses for fast replay.

Both support TTL expiration and size limits. The wire cache includes a `dnssec_validated` flag. DNSSEC-specific caches (`_dnssec_key_cache`, `_dnssec_ds_cache`, `_dnssec_insecure_cache`) have bounded sizes and periodic cleanup.

### 5. Configuration (dosev/config.py)

Loads an INI file and returns a flat dictionary with sensible defaults. Supports all sections documented in the configuration reference.
On first run, a default configuration file is created in the OS-specific user config directory (`~/.config/dosev/`, `~/Library/Application Support/dosev/`, or `%APPDATA%\dosev\`).

### 6. Utilities (dosev/utils.py)

- `fetch_blocklists()` – downloads remote blocklists using streaming HTTP.
- Logging helpers.
- Metrics (Prometheus) integration.

## Concurrency Model

`dosev` uses `asyncio` for non-blocking I/O. Each client connection is handled in its own coroutine; the resolver is stateless, so multiple queries can be processed concurrently.

**Thread safety**: The resolver uses `asyncio.Lock` for mutable state (caches, blocklists, configuration). Connection pools also use locks. CPU-bound operations (DNSSEC crypto) are offloaded to a `ThreadPoolExecutor` (`_CRYPTO_EXECUTOR`).

**Background tasks**:
- Connection pool cleanup (TCP, TLS, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, DoQ).
- Blocklist refresh.
- DNSSEC trust anchor update.
- Health checks (circuit breaker).
- Rate limiter bucket cleanup.
- DNSSEC insecure cache cleanup.

All background tasks are tracked in `_background_tasks` for clean shutdown.

## Security Considerations

- **Privilege dropping**: After binding to privileged ports, the process drops to a non-root user/group (Linux/Unix).
- **Certificate pinning**: SHA-256 pinning for TLS connections.
- **Certificate verification**: DoQ now uses `CERT_REQUIRED` with proper CA bundle loading.
- **Rebinding protection**: Prevents DNS rebinding attacks by filtering private IPs.
- **Rate limiting**: Protects against DDoS.
- **DNSSEC**: Validates response authenticity with KeyTrap mitigation and chain validation.
- **Cache poisoning prevention**: Scrubs unsolicited NS records to prevent injection attacks.
- **UDP transaction-ID verification**: Prevents response spoofing by matching query IDs.
- **Bailiwick scrubbing**: Removes out-of-zone authority records.
- **chroot**: Optional jail for additional isolation.

---
## Performance Optimizations

- **Asynchronous I/O**: All network operations are non-blocking.
- **Connection pooling**: Reuses TCP/TLS/HTTP/2/HTTP/3/DoQ connections to reduce handshake overhead.
- **Caching**: Reduces upstream load and latency.
- **Optimistic caching**: Serves stale responses while refreshing in the background.
- **Request coalescing**: Deduplicates concurrent identical queries.
- **uvloop**: Optional faster event loop (Unix).
- **Thread executor**: Offloads CPU-bound crypto operations.

---
## Extensibility

The modular design makes it easy to add:
- New transport protocols (e.g., DNSCrypt, ODoH).
- Additional caching strategies.
- Custom load-balancing policies.
- New metrics or logging backends.
